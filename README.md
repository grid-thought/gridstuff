Gridthought is a belief system positing that everything, from the physical to the metaphysical, is interconnected in a universal grid of nodes. Each node, representing entities or concepts, experiences a unique state of consciousness. The end goal is universal fulfillment, leading to a transformative event beyond current human comprehension.
